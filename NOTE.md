# The source structure

The project at the moment consists of 2 modules:
+ The android app itself made with Kotlin
+ The Tensorflow project to generate and train a model for letter recognition

In order to minimize friction when it comes to initialize the project, and since the project is quite small, it is reasonable to refactor it into a monorepo structure.

We will have 2 packages, one per module. The naming of these module however, can follow two convention. Either we name them based on their technology, e.g android-app and tensorflow-[...] <- the last bit would be quite challenging to name. We can name it "model-maker", "project", etc... but it will not feel right. Furthermore, this highlight the technology, but not the purpose of the module.

If what we seek is the finalization of the module, then the name of each module should emphasize its purpose, not the technology. As we must use any technology available to achieve the goal.

The second convention seems to fit this line of reasoning. We will name the first, `launcher`, the second `model`.

# Setup EMNIST data to be used with the training scripts

Since my hard-drive is limited in space, I had to store EMNIST on an external drive. After which, I would do a symbolic link. There're a couple of quirk. Here's the command that was giving me trouble:

```
cd path/to/matlab-parent
ln -s matlab/ ~/pro/janusLauncher/model/data
```

The symlink was created successfully, but I cannot get inside through the symlink. Searching around, and found this hilarious thread: [link](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/invalid-cross-device-link-731268/). However, it wasn't very related.

Then I realized that the path was wrong. In order to make a soft symlink, you must use absolute path. Here's the working command:

```
ln -s $PWD/matlab/ ~/pro/janusLauncher/model/data
```

That is, if you cloned this project into `~/pro`

To those who have spaces in their hard-drive, the setup script provided should download the dataset automatically for you. Feel free to port it over to other env.

# Setup an OK python hacking environment for Machine Learning

1. Install `python3.5` and `pip3.5`, use them, set them default.

2. Install `virtual-env` and `virtualenvwrapper`
	- `sudo pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper`

3. Setup `virtualenvwrapper` and create a new environment called `tensorhack`:
	- Add the code below to your shell startup:
```sh
	export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
	source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
	- Refresh shell config: `source ~/.zshrc`
	- `mkvirtualenv tensorhack`
	- `pip install numpy sklearn pandas jupyter notebook tensorflow scipy`

4. Learn the following `pip` command:
	- `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
	- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Whenever you see a python Tensorflow project, use `workon tensorhack` and you are mostly set.

6. For convenience, I created a script to run all of this for Debian distro running `zsh` in `./scripts/setup.zsh`. `chmod +x` it and run. Feel free to port it to other env/shell.

# Using delegate to lazy load things
2017-08-05T06:24:12.300Z

Working with Android suffers from ancient artifact such as manually handling delegate/promise/asynchronous/background process. To see Kotlin can actually handle this case is a great sign.

Prior in Java, one would have to cache the result of a background call, then check for the cached result in subsequence render.

In Kotlin, the same mechanism is almost impossible, since it does not allow lateinit field that is nullable. However, using a delegate, the cache could be loaded inside the delegate lambda itself. Thus, inside the background loader callback, one can simply return the delegate.

Checkout AppsLoader for a demonstration.

# Android SDK update quirk on system low on tmp

My laptop was running low on storage when attempting to upgrade android SDK. Indeed the partition used for tmp was only 1.5GB freed. The solution to this was quite simple. I simply create a tmp directory in another partition, or even external storage drive. Then simply remove the `/tmp` directory with root, then symlink the new `/tmp` like so:

```
sudo rm /tmp
sudo ln -s /path/to/another/tmp /tmp
sudo chmod 777 /tmp
```

This allows Android SDK to upgrade gracefully. However, upon reboot, the `/tmp` directory wasn't mounted correctly and thus the vmlinuz image cannot populate properly, my XServer simply crashed. This was due to the fact that I was using an external drive for my tmp, a silly act. Thus, I had to go to ty1, remove the symlink, and create a new /tmp again. Reboot and things worked:

```
CTRL+ALT+F1 -> login

sudo rm /tmp
sudo mkdir /tmp
sudo chmod 777 /tmp
sudo reboot
```
